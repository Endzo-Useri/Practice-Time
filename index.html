        <h1>The Road to Code</h1>
        <p class="font-size">In February of 2021, feeling the need to learn something new, I searched online looking for a way to reunite with my old friend, <strong>Algebra!</strong>  I have always loved numbers and working out mathmetical solutions in my head.  Mathematics was the one course that I excelled in during high school.  My search eventually landed me at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" class="link">khanacademy.org</a>.  Here, I not only rediscovered a platform for relearning mathematics but I also discovered JavaScript.</p>
        <p class="font-size">One thing lead to another and I landed on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" class="link">freeCodeCamp.org</a></p>

        <h2>Stops Along the Way</h2>
        <p class="sm-font">Every chance I get, I am learning to code.  I change it up from time to time; HTML & CSS for a time then JS for a time.  I explore different venues for <strong>learning to code</strong> such as a YouTuber or another site.  I do this to <em>diversify</em> and maintain my sanity.  This gives me a chance to absorb what I have just learned and, at the sane time, allows my mind to be refreshed while learing something new.</p>

        <h2>The Journey Around the World!</h2>
        <p class="sm-font">The next stop on my journer is all the endearing friendships that I have been blessed with from being a part of Scrimba's Discord community.</p>
